# Problem Statement 2:

Shift allowance service (Console) app (Python) As we are growing in our nearshore services, we would like to have a system which can support services team to manage the data and take care of shift allowance effectively.

Following data are stored in DB against shift details.

a. Name
b. Reporting Manager
c. Project
d. Location
e. Gender
f. Start Date
g. Recurring (Yes/No)
h. End Date
i. Start Time


# Create an application which can take care of following automations

1. Email should be sent to manager, employee, HR and accounts team whenever a new shift record is added to the system
2. Every 15th and 22nd day of the month manager should get email notification to update the records for their reportees. List of managers is to be identified from shift details.
3. On request shift details should be exported in excel format, if there are multiple details for an employee, pick details for the current month
4. Calculate shift allowance based on Start time and End time a. Use this logic to calculate Shift allowance%

	i. 2< # of hours above 10:00 PM < 3 : 10 % of total CTC
	ii. 3< # of hours post 10:00 PM < 5/2 % of total CTC
	iii. 5< # of hours post 10:00 PM: 50% of total CTC
